## Sektion 5: Founder Story

### Headline
**"I Fired Myself From My Own Company."**

### Story (Example)
"Two years ago, I was drowning. My business had potential, but I was working 80-hour weeks on tasks that didn't matter. Strategy docs, code changes, customer onboarding – I was doing it all.

Then I realized something: I wasn't building a business. I was building a job for myself.

So I started experimenting with AI. Not just ChatGPT, but a real system. A framework. I used Manus AI for strategy, Claude Code for development, and N8N for automation.

Within weeks, my business transformed. I went from 80-hour weeks to 20-hour weeks. My revenue tripled. My stress disappeared.

That framework – the 3 Vibes – is what I'm sharing in Business Autopilot. It's the system I wish I had when I started.

This isn't a course about theory. It's a practical, step-by-step guide to building a business that doesn't need you to run it."

## Tonalität & Sprachmuster

Die Sprache sollte:
- **Direkt & ehrlich sein:** "Keine Codierung erforderlich. Keine Entwickler nötig."
- **Transformation-fokussiert sein:** Immer das "Vorher → Nachher" zeigen
- **Actionable sein:** Konkrete Ergebnisse versprechen, nicht nur Konzepte
- **Authentisch sein:** Echte Geschichten, echte Resultate
- **Motivierend sein:** Aber realistisch – nicht zu viel versprechen

Die **3 Vibes** sollten in jedem Abschnitt präsent sein, um Konsistenz und Klarheit zu schaffen.
